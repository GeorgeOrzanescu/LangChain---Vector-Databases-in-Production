    "- Now, let’s improve the previous section by using **Output Parsers**. The Pydantic output parser in LangChain offers a flexible way to shape the outputs from language models according to pre-defined schemas.  When used alongside prompt templates, it enables more structured interactions with language models, making it easier to extract and work with the information provided by the model.\n",
    "- The prompt template includes the format instructions from our parser, which guide the language model to produce the output in the desired structured format. The idea is to demonstrate how you could use PydanticOutputParser class to receive the output as a type List that holds each bullet point instead of a string. The advantage of having a list is the possibility to loop through the results or index a specific item.\n",
    "- As mentioned before, the **PydanticOutputParser** wrapper is used to create a parser that will parse the output from the string into a data structure. The custom ArticleSummary class, which inherits the Pydantic package’s BaseModel class, will be used to parse the model’s output.\n",
    "- We defined the schema to present a title along with a summary variable that represents a list of strings using the Field object. The description argument will describe what each variable must represent and help the model to achieve it. Our custom class also includes a validator function to ensure that the generated output contains at least three bullet points."
